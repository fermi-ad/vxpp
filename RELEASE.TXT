Description

    VWPP is a C++ library that wraps VxWorks concurrency primitives with type-
    and exception-safe objects. These classes manage resources using modern C++
    idioms. This library is documented at

        http://www-bd.fnal.gov/issues/wiki/Vwpp

Announcing v2.1 of VWPP

    Changes from 2.0:

    - Added a "mix-in" class called NoHeap. Any class derived from this class
      prevents instances from being allocated on the heap. VWPP uses this to
      prevent mutexes and their locks from being created on the stack (where
      an object's lifetime is less-defined.)

    - We no longer support VxWorks 6.1.

System Preparation

    VWPP has been built for every supported target under VxWorks 6.4 and 6.7.
    If you run across any incompatibilities, please let the Front-End Group
    <fe-group@fnal.gov> know.

Location

    Our development environment now supports quite a few combinations of
    hardware and software platforms. Be sure to download from the appropriate
    area.

    Rather than load this module, one could also link their module with the
    static library. For instance, to build a module called demo.out, a Makefile
    might define the rule as:

        demo.out : demo.o ${PRODUCTS_LIBDIR}/libvwpp-2.1.a
	        ${make-mod}
