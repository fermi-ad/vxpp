Announcing v2.5 of VWPP

Description

    VWPP is a C++ library that wraps VxWorks concurrency primitives with type-
    and exception-safe objects. These classes manage resources using modern C++
    idioms. This library is documented at

        https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/vxpp/wiki

Changes from 2.4:

    - Created an exception class, vwpp::timeout_error, which is derived from
      std::runtime_error. This exception is thrown when a timeout value is
      given and the operation times out. Previously, code would catch this
      condition using std::runtime_error. That code will still work. However,
      using vwpp:timeout_error lets your code distinguish timeout errors from
      other run-time errors.

    - The vwpp::NoHeap class now prevents the use of placement-new operators on
      classes derived from it.

    - The vwpp::Event class is now a template. Only two specializations are
      allowed: vwpp::Event<vwpp::TaskSignal> and vwpp::Event<vwpp::IntSignal>.
      If no template parameter is provided, it defaults to vwpp::IntSignal
      since getting signaled from an interrupt is the primary use of this
      primitive.

    - The vwpp::VME::A16 template has been generalized and is now
      vwpp::VME::Memory<AddressSpace tag, size_t size, typename LockType>.

System Preparation

    VWPP has been built for every supported target under VxWorks 6.4 and 6.7.
    If you run across any incompatibilities, please let us know. The project is
    being managed under Redmine (https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/vxpp).
    You can report problems using the issue tracker.

Location

    Our development environment supports several combinations of hardware and
    software platforms. Be sure to download from the appropriate area.

    Rather than load this module, one could also link their module with the
    static library. For instance, to build a module called demo.out, a Makefile
    might define the rule as:

        demo.out : demo.o ${PRODUCTS_LIBDIR}/libvwpp-2.5.a
	        ${make-mod}
