Announcing v2.2 of VWPP

Description

    VWPP is a C++ library that wraps VxWorks concurrency primitives with type-
    and exception-safe objects. These classes manage resources using modern C++
    idioms. This library is documented at

        http://www-bd.fnal.gov/issues/wiki/Vwpp

Changes from 2.1:

    - Added vwpp::Task::isValid() which returns a boolean indicating
      whether the VxWorks task associated with the object exists and,
      is so, if it's not suspended. In other words, is the VxWorks
      task healthy.

    - Added vwpp::CondVar<>. The VxWorks native concurrency primitives
      don't include support for condition variables (which the POSIX
      interface does.) This version of the library provides an
      implementation that doesn't require POSIX support in the
      kernel. This class should be be considered experimental until
      further notice. I'd appreciate others to review the
      implementation and try it out.

System Preparation

    VWPP has been built for every supported target under VxWorks 6.4 and 6.7.
    If you run across any incompatibilities, please let us know. The project is
    being managed under Redmine (https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/vxpp).
    You can report problems using the issue tracker.

Location

    Our development environment supports several combinations of hardware and
    software platforms. Be sure to download from the appropriate area.

    Rather than load this module, one could also link their module with the
    static library. For instance, to build a module called demo.out, a Makefile
    might define the rule as:

        demo.out : demo.o ${PRODUCTS_LIBDIR}/libvwpp-2.2.a
	        ${make-mod}
