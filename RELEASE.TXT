Announcing v2.0 of VWPP

    This is a updated API to the VWPP library. Because some of the changes
    are not backward compatible, the API's major version number has been
    incremented.

    Changes from the 1.x API:

    - The API uses templates instead of a class hierarchy. This allows the
      compiler to inline the code better.

    - The Interrupt, Scheduler, Protection, and Priority classes have been
      pulled from the Task class so code that isn't part of a Task object can
      benefit from the scoping of these locks.

    - Due to more agressive use of templates, this version no longer compiles
      under the 5.5 compiler. If you wish to use the new API, your front-end
      must be using a 6.x kernel (which is a good idea anyway.)

Description

    VWPP is a C++ library that wraps the VxWorks concurrency primitives. The
    C++ classes implement modern C++ programming styles in managing resources.
    This library is documented at

        http://www-bd.fnal.gov/issues/wiki/Vwpp

System Preparation

    VWPP has been built for every supported target under VxWorks 6.1, 6.4 and
    6.7. If you run across any incompatibilities, please let the Front-End
    Group <fe-group@fnal.gov> know.

Location

    Our development environment now supports quite a few combinations of
    hardware and software platforms. Be sure to download from the appropriate
    area.

    Rather than load this module, one could also link their module
    with the static library. For instance, to build a module called
    demo.out, a Makefile might define the rule as:

        demo.out : demo.o ${PRODUCTS_LIBDIR}/libvwpp-2.0.a
	        ${make-mod}
